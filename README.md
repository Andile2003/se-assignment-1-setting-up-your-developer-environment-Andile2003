5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   Step 1: Make that python is installed and verify on the command prompt by writing 'python --version'.

   Step 2: Pip gets pre installed with Python, Verify the 'pip' installation by commanding 'pip --version'. 

   Step 3: If pip is not already installed, download 'get-pip.py' by running curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py.

   Step 4: Run the scripts by typing python get-pip.py.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   Step 1: Visit the download page, https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html click the first download button after clicking it don't sign up just click the 'No thanks, just start my download' ![alt text](<My sql download page.png>)

   Step 2: After the download go to the downloads run it to start the installation process.

   Step 3: Installer setup, The MySQL Installer will show instructions for the setup. Choose "Developer Default" or "Server only" options for a typical installation. You can customize installation options if needed.

   Step 4: Configuration, during installation, you may be prompted to configure MySQL settings such as root password, port number and more. Follow the instructions and set these options according to your preferences or leave them as default.

   Step 5: Once the installation completes successfully, you should see a confirmation message.

   Step 6: verify that MySQL has been installed correctly, you can try connecting to the MySQL server using the command line or MySQL Workbench.

   Step 7: Connect to MySQL server, Use the 'mysql' command-line client to connect to MySQL and run 'mysql -u root -p'. Enter your root password when prompted.

   Step 8: Launch MySQL Workbench, configure a new connection using the credentials set during installation.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

    Step 1: Install docker,  Firstly install Docker on your machine. Docker provides containers that encapsulate your application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.

   Step 2: Create a 'Dockerfile' in the root of your project. This file specifies the environment your application needs to run. Adjust the FROM line and commands according to your specific application and its dependencies.

   Step 3: In the directory containing your 'Dockerfile', run: 'docker build -t my-node-app'.This command builds a Docker image named 'my-node-app' based on your 'Dockerfile'.

   Step 4: Once the image is built, you can run a container based on it: docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app. Reference (https://chatgpt.com/c/89d6f3ed-4889-4d69-9fac-f47c91084811)

   Virtual Machine Approach:

   Step 1: Choose a Virtualization Tool: Install a virtualization platform like VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V.

   Step 2: Create a new virtual machine and configure its settings (CPU, memory, disk space) according to your projectâ€™s requirements.
   
   Step 3: Install an operating system suitable for your project on the virtual machine.
   
   Step 4: Install all necessary dependencies and tools within the virtual machine as you would on a physical machine. Reference (https://chatgpt.com/c/89d6f3ed-4889-4d69-9fac-f47c91084811)

   Benefits of using a virtual machine

   Isolation: Virtualization provides a way to isolate different applications and operating systems from each other on the same physical machine. This isolation prevents conflicts and ensures that one application or environment does not affect others, improving overall stability and security.
   
   Efficient Resource Utilization: Virtualization allows you to run multiple virtual machines or containers on a single physical server. This optimizes the use of hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and storage, leading to cost savings and increased efficiency compared to running each application on separate physical machines. Reference (https://chatgpt.com/c/89d6f3ed-4889-4d69-9fac-f47c91084811)

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

   Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
   
   Extensions Marketplace: VS Code has a vast marketplace for extensions. Some essential ones included.
   
   ESLint: Linting tool for JavaScript and TypeScript to catch errors and enforce coding styles.
   
   Prettier: Code formatter for various languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, etc., ensuring consistent code style.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

    When doing this assignment had no obsticles I must say because I finished it without struggling. Even though I did not have all the screenshorts that were needed I made sure that I cover in writing and making a picture in writing. Some of the things that were needed to e installed I had them on my PC so I did not have any struggles. Some of them was the first time seeing them so I used an AI tool which I referenced where I was supposed to. This assignment made me learn about many things in technology since I am a beginner I learnt so much while doing it.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.
